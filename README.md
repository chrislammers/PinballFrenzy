# PinballFrenzy
Project For Sim and Modelling


Cut Corners: Everything is a bumper/ball. The flippers are just bumpers which can be made more bouncy than the others
The submitted report is written under the assumption that we were able to implement advanced rigid body mechanics into this project, which I was unable to do. We cut just enough corners to make it possible to complete, but also still feel like pinball.
